# can edit in /etc/network/interfaces or in the following tool
nmcli -o 
# edit ip address with
nmcli con mod eth0 ipv4.address
# optional find the location of the config file and edit there
nmcli -f NAME,FILENAME connection

# as an alternate to the GUI NetworkManager or editing the config manually, you can use systemd-networkd for Deboam=based distros
# with either NetworkManager or systemd-networkd, Ubuntu uses an automation technology called Netplan that abstracts networking configuration paramaters
# and then communicates those to a renderer--use either the NetworkManager or systemd-networkd not both.
# putty into the gui-less server then type the following command
systemctl status systemd-networkd
# this is the default config plan using YAML--careful to preserve indentation structure.
cat /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml
netplan apply

JOINING A DOMAIN
######
# configure name servers. Edditing this config won't be permanent on reboot.
cat /etc/resolv.conf
resolvectl status

# to join a domain the linux server must be on a subnet that can contact a DC and DNS server configured with AD's key SRV records.
# use dig to find the start of authority for domain.local
dig soa domain.local
# find ldap server on port 389
dig SRV _ldap._tcp.domain.local

# test that the machine can discover the domain
realm discover
# verify that a required package is installed (run for others shown in the output for realm discover if desired)
dnf search oddjob
# edit hostname as necessary
hostnamectl set-hostname servername.domain.local
# make sure system time is +- 5 min of domain controller's time.
# join the domain domain.local and put into the Servers OU
realm join --computer-ou="ou=Servers,dc=domain,dc=local"
# verify
getent group "domain users@domain.local"
