# TEST INSTALLATION
# run the following commands to set the user and group that own files in the default website directory
# www-data is the group account Apache uses to server requests
sudo chown -R <logged in username>:www-data /var/www/html
# set permissions (7=rwx to owner set by chown above.  This is not the sql login user, but the sudo linux user, 5 = rw to www-data group, 0 = no permissions to others)
sudo chomd -R 750 /var/www/html
# set new site files to inheret group permissions
sudo chmod g+s /var/www/html

# test PHP is correctly installed to make a simple test script into the document root of the website
echo "<?php phpinfo(); ?>" > > /var/www/html/phpinfo.php
# open a browser http://<ip address>/phpinfo.php
# you will see phpinfo.php has been created with different permissions (644).  Many sites use 750 for directories and 640 for files.  Check documentation.
